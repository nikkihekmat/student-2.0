## Self and Team Reflection

I delivered the pitch well for my group. I made it short and engaging, acknolwedged the minor kinks in the project, but marketed the site well. My team worked very hard to qualify for this event, and each of us played an integral part into the making of the project. Overall feedback we recieved on the demo was:
- Glows:
    - good colors
    - aesthetically pleasing layout 
    - user friendly site
    - very practical use  
- Grows:
    - fix the saving issue on the "List" page 
    - fix the login page

## Event Reflection 

I was impressed by the turnout in the CompSci room. The room was filled with parents interested in our projects. I was also impressed by ther ceramics exhibit in the arts area. My favorites were the painted gnomes!
