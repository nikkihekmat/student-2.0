    "Correct Answer: (B) Four\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Wrong Answer: (A) Three\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer was incorrect because removing any three connections would still mean there is one path that devices B and C could use to communicate; I simply missed it in my analysis. For example, if the connections A-C, C-D, and B-D are removed, B and C could still reach each other through B-E-F-C.\n",

    "\n",
    "My answer was incorrect because the code I chose causes the robot to end in center of the grid and face the bottom.The given code segment dicatates thatsince MOVE_FORWARD is outside the inner loop, the robot moves forward 1 time for each iteration of the outer loop and rotates left count number of times for each iteration of the inner loop. This means that the robot SHOULD follow a path where it ends in the lower-right corner of the grid and faces the top.\n",

    "Correct Answer: (A) 3\n",

    "Wrong Answer: (B) 4\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer is wrong because the code segment is counting the number of odd values in the list of integers, not the number of even values. If it was even values the answer would be 4, as there are four even numbers in the list. But since it is counting the amount of odd integers, and there are only three, the answer is 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "My answer is wrong because a simulation is run on a computer and is not likely to require input from individuals distributed around the world, which is what a citizen project means (aka C doesn't satisfy what a citizen projcet would need).\n",
