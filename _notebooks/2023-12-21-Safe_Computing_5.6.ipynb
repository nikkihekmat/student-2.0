    "\n",
    "What is Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and list three examples of it?\n",
    "- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is information about someone that can be used to identify them. This could include your name, date of birth, and email. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is a possible risk or cons to using PII?\n",
    "- A possible risk or con to using PII is that people can exploit it to steal your data and accomplish identity theft. Inserting your credit card information online could result in credit card theft easily, so for instance it's always important to trust the site you are using to online shop. PII can also result in a website collecting your information to try to target ads towards you.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are traits of a strong password?\n",
    "- Traits of a strong password include having 10 or more characters, including a symbol, including a number, and having both lowercase and uppercase letters. The more of these you include in your password, the harder it is for someone to login to any of your accounts to steal your information. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does having a strong password prevent?\n",
    "- Having a strong password prevents people from logging into your private accounts. This could protect sensitive information, and prevent things such as identity and credit card theft.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the two types of decryption and what is the difference between the two?\n",
    "- Two types of decryption (the process of decoding data) are symmetric and asymmetic encryption. Symmetric encryption is when one key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data, for instance Ceasar Cipher. Asymmetric encryption is different in that it uses two keys: a public key for encrypting, and a private key for decrypting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is phishing?\n",
    "- Phishing is tricking a user into giving personal information such as usernames, passwords, account numbers, or social security numbers. This could come in the form of emails that look trustwory but will trick you into clicking a link or attatchment that collects your data or puts a virus on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is a way a keylogger can get into your computer?\n",
    "- A way a keylogger can get into your computer is by plugging in a physical device to your computer. This device would manually collect your private data and information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a rogue access point and how is it used?\n",
    "- A rouge access point is a wireless network giving unauthorized access to secure networks. It is used to intercept data as it travels through networks, collecting one's information."
