    "## 2020 Practice MCQ Research + Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This was simple math. You begin with 2 and add four 3s to the expression because the image said to begin with 2 and repeat 3 four times to yield the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A \"citizen science\" approach to analyzing images is useful for a wildfire research project because it's faster to use a distributed group of people than solely the reserach team. \"Citizen science\" involves volunteers in the scientific research process, keeping the public involved and engaged to expedite the research process. There's more manpower and a wider knowledge base to utilize when more people are involved.  \n",
    "    - Link: [Citizen Science - Importance and Benefits](https://maritime-forum.ec.europa.eu/contents/citizen-science-importance-and-benefits_en#:~:text=The%20main%20benefit%20of%20involving,efficient%20ways%20to%20solve%20issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This is simple logic, similar to the math probelem in question (1). The block code is structured in a way to repeat the statement \"red red blue\" 3 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I learned this when we made our binary calculator for the first CPT project of Trimester 2. We had a limit of how many bits the calculator could represent, so very large binary conversions wouldn't show up fully on the calculator because of the bit limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. <mark>Even with research, this didn't make sense! I'll highlight the questions I got stuck on from here on out.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To see which program got the robot to the gray square, I mentally tested out program I and II. Both programs' sequences worked, so I chose that as my response.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This is common sense; statement \"C\" is false. A flight simulation will never teach someone better than an actual flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. I learned these helpful steps of program development by working with my scrum team over the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We learned in a the Safe Computing team teach on 12/21 that sending data using public-key encryption provides the most security when transmitting private data. This is because it uses two keys instead of one. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. I learned about booleans through my trimester 1 team teach presentation. Answer \"B\" is correct because it uses psuedo code to describe the correct information about the cost of a ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. I know the answer is \"A\" by converting each decimal number to binary in the table and seeing which binary RBG triplet matches the origial binary one listed. I had some background knowledge on this from our binary CPT project.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. <mark> I got stuck on this question, even with consulting outside resources. </mark> \n",
    "\n",
    "13. You would not be able to tell how many bookw weren't borrowed in a year by a student if you only collected data on the book that had been borrowed. The library catalog constantly changes, and the data wouldn't be simple to calculate or keep track of.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Step 3 makes sense because it is the only option that uses the full data from the last step. The other options either leave out use of the remainder or leave out use of the integer quotient previously calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Both programs have an output of values 2-11, but get there in different ways. One starts at 1 and goes to 11, while the other starts at an input of 0 and carries until 10, but then there is an extra step where \"1\" is added to each value. \n",
    "\n",
    "16. <mark> I could not understand this problem. </mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "17. After consulting many sources and looking up the definitions of the terms used, I concluded that bit sequences display almsot anything.\n",
    "    - [Alphanumeric Character](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/alphanumeric-alphameric#:~:text=Alphanumeric%2C%20also%20referred%20to%20as,Arabic%20numerals%2C%200%20to%209.)\n",
    "    - [Machine Language Instruction + Can it be represented by bits?](https://www.britannica.com/technology/machine-language)\n",
    "\n",
    "18. \"B\" is correct because it uses simple logic to get the robot to the gray square. The robot is ordered to move until it can't and rotate at that point to repeat the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "19. This was as simple as reading the trend of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. You get this answer by dividing the total amount of data stored in a year by the number of registered users in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. You can get this answer by adding up the percentages in the pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. For this question I simply matched the psuedo code with how big the segments of the pie chart were.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Option \"B\" uses the correct psuedo code to dictate when someone will be available, and the information is taken correctly from the above image.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. We know it's the even integers because it says we are adding 2 to 0 originally. The range is 2-20 because the process is being repeated 10 times, and 10 times 2 is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. II and III are correct because I've learned about them in a team teach. I know \"I\" is incorrect because it's impossible for one computer to keep track of the entire internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. A duplicate copy of the data is not going to be part of the data associated with an image itself because it would be for a separate copy of the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. This is a common-sense question. Computers can't solve everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. II doesn't work because it repeats temp = alpha twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Option \"A\" is the only one that explains how an audio file is actually processed. It has to go through a stage of compression before being transferred to another device.\n",
    "- [The Important Difference Between Audio and File Compression](https://www.soundguys.com/audio-compression-explained-29148/)\n",
    "\n",
    "30. The value cannot be out of range because part of the program is to multiply the number negatively, so values can exist forever into the negatives (since they were never restricted by the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "31. We learned about copyright in a team teach. You always need permission to use a copyrighted item.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. \"D\" calculates the average correctly while also taking out the lowest score in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. You cannot know the highest assignment score if the only data you're getting is the average scores, the number of assignments, and the course grade after the lowest score is dropped. So the answer is \"A.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "34. I chose \"B\" by counting the number of spaces the robot needed to move before rotating each time to get to the gray square, and the sequence was 1, 2, 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. \"B\" combines the two processes simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. I learned \"A\" in a team teach. Runtime is dependent on how complex something is.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. The answer is \"A\" because \"endY - 2\" needs to happen for the coordinate point on the y-axis to move down by 2 each time the function repeats. \n",
    "\n",
    "38. This site taught me that IPv6 provides an infinite number of addresses, so it decreases the IP exhaustion problem. \n",
    "- [Differences Between IPv4 and IPv6](https://www.linksys.com/in/support-article/?articleNum=139604#:~:text=The%20Internet%20Protocol%20version%206,the%20IP%20address%20exhaustion%20problem.)\n",

    "\n",
    "41. I understood the answer was \"C\" by reading the instructions of the problem thoroughly. The question described the process well.\n",
    "\n",
    "42. \"D\" is correct because it establishes that the score could fall in a range 10 points above or below the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. I learned about redundant routing in my own team teach this trimester. Redundant routing is possible in both configurations between Q and V because Q and V are already connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. I learned about redundant routing in my Tri 2 team teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. \"D\" is correct because it adds that you could win if the sum also equals 0, not only 3. This is correct because you could win by flipping the coin one way or the other all three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. The site below taught me that as a new device is connected to the internet, it is assigned an IP address to enable communication on the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "51. We learned about Creative Commons in a team teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. \"A\" is the answer because Option 1 is the only thing explicityly stated in the psuedo code.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. We learned about crowdsourcing in a team teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. <mark> i dont know </mark>>\n",
    "\n",
    "55. The answer is option \"A\" because people need to represent themselves only with the number 1 (becuse one person doesn't equal two peopple), and they need to write their height at the top of their cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. Version II takes 5 minutes longer than Version I because the algorithm has to go through each number in the list.\n",

    "58. The answer is \"C\" because the expression doesn't work since x doesn't equal y and y doesn't equal z.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. I learned about open source software in a team teach. \n",
    "\n",
    "60. \"D\" is the best option because it address each list separately first and then does the appropriate expression at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "61. We learned about the digital divide in a team teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. There needed to be the option to display x for the answer to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. We are only concerened about selling a certain genre, so we don't need to know the title or author of a book to do calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. \"B\" does not work because multiplying 2 by -5 repeatedly will never make a value greater than -5. \"D\" is a similar situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. <mark> I just guessed </mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "66. Lines 5 and 9 can go because they are repeats of already existing code. We wouldn't get rid of 8 and 11 because they are already in brackets. \n",

    "16. I originally put C, but the answer is D. According to College Board, this is because \"inserting the statement between lines 6 and 7 means that the index is only decremented when an occurrence of \"the\" or \"a\" is found. Instead, the index should be decremented after each element is checked.\"\n",

    "23. I orginally but B, but D is correct. I had accidentally chosen a psuedo code that said miles could be equal to 20 or greater, but that didn't match the image. Miles could only have been less than 20 to satisfy the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. I orginally put B, but the answer is C. I had misunderstood what the psuedo code meant. My choice, according to College Board meant that: \". . . the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right one time so that it faces right, and moves it forward one square. The second call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right 2 times so that it faces left , then moves it forward one square. The third call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right 3 times so that it faces the bottom of the grid, then moves it forward one square back to where it started.\" To be honest, looking at this explanation I still don't unders"
