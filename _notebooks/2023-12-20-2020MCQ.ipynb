A \"citizen science\" approach to analyzing images is useful for a wildfire research project because it's faster to use a distributed group of people than solely the reserach team. \"Citizen science\" involves volunteers in the scientific research process, keeping the public involved and engaged to expedite the research process. There's more manpower and a wider knowledge base to utilize when more people are involved.  \n",
